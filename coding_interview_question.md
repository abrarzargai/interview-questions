1. Write a JavaScript function to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

2. Implement a function that flattens a nested array in JavaScript, converting it into a single-level array. 

3. Write a function that determines if two strings are anagrams of each other  

4. Create a JavaScript function that returns the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number, utilizing memoization for optimized performance. 

5. Implement a function to reverse a string without using the built-in reverse() method.

6. Given an array of numbers, write a function to find the largest and smallest numbers in the array. 

7. Given a string, write a function to count the occurrences of each character in the string. 

8. Write a function that reverses the order of words in a sentence without using the built-in reverse() method. 

9. Implement a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) while ignoring whitespace and punctuation.

10. Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the largest difference between any two numbers in the array. 

11. Implement a function that removes duplicates from an array, keeping only the unique elements.

12. Write a function that accepts a number and returns its factorial (e.g., factorial of 5 is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1). 

15. Implement a function that flattens a nested array into a single-dimensional array.
